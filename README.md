# Antimicrobial-Peptide-QSAR
ML model to predict antimicrobial peptides using 2 datasets consisting of antimicrobial peptides (positive set) and non-antimicrobial peptides (negative set). The peptide features are then quantified using the Gini index to show the most important peptides and demonstrated using both single animo acids and dipeptide features from the datasets.
